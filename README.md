# Hi There! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub homepage. I am Michael Kimber. 

## Portfolio Video
This is a **1min 55sec** demoreel. 🎬
It is slightly unconventional (I lost a ton of data in my most recent move), neverthless, it's something. I intended it to showcase elements of my creative process. I have embeded a cover image that redirects to the unlisted YouTube video. If that somehow breaks, please use the [following link](https://youtu.be/W6GLbJJNRk0)). And if that is also broken, please connect with me on LinkedIn and let me know so I can fix it.

In the future, I intend to have sub-pages that re-dorect to elements showcased on this page.
