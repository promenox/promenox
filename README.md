# Hi There! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub homepage. I am Michael Kimber. 

## Portfolio Video 🎬
**1 min 55 sec** ⌚️
[![Michael Kimber's Portfolio Cover Video](assets/mkimber_portfolio_cover_img.png)](https://youtu.be/W6GLbJJNRk0)

It is slightly unconventional - I lost a ton of data in a recent move. 

The video is intended to showcase elements of my creative process. Clicking the cover image will redirect to an unlisted YouTube video. If that somehow breaks, please use the [following link](https://youtu.be/W6GLbJJNRk0)). 

If that link is also broken, connect with me on LinkedIn and I'll fix it.

In the future, I intend to have sub-pages that re-direct to elements showcased on this homepage. 

### Video Highlights
- Narrative Framework.
- MVP Build Style.
- Project Management.
- AI / ML / Programming (More Soon... 👷‍♂️)
- Proceduralism. 
- Math / Physics.
- Design Thinking.
- Stuff I Taught.
